            <h2 class="h2">Ferrari - Points: 93</h2>
           <p class="p1">Scuderia Ferrari is the racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer
            Ferrari and the racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also known by the nickname 
            "The Prancing Horse" (Italian: il Cavallino Rampante or simply il Cavallino), in reference to their logo.
            It is the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having competed in every world championship since 1950.
            The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo. By 1947, Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, Bathurst 12 Hour, races for Grand tourer cars, and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia, and the Carrera Panamericana. The team is also known for its passionate support base, known as the tifosi. 
            The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is regarded as the team's home race.

            <h2 class="h2">McLaren Mercedes - Points: 55</h2>
           <p class="p1">Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was founded in September 1963 to run a Cooper T70-Climax in the Tasman Series which Bruce McLaren promptly won that close-season. 
            A Formula 1 car was introduced three years later McLaren scoring the team's breakthrough success in the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix. 
            However, the respected New Zealander was killed on June 2 1970 while testing a Can-Am car at Goodwood.
            With Teddy Mayer at the helm and Denny Hulme a galvanising force, the team recovered despite that considerable loss.
            Emerson Fittipaldi won the 1974 World Championship and both Mark Donohue and Johnny Rutherford were successful at Indianapolis that decade. James Hunt replaced Fittipaldi in 1976 and clinched a dramatic last-gasp world title that year â€“ a success immortalised in the film Rush.
