            The new Formula 1 season is tantalisingly close with a
            bumper slate of 24 races to play out over the course of the campaign.
            Max Verstappen is the favourite to go all the way once again and clinch his fourth successive world title.
            Red Bull's dominance has been stark in recent seasons with the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari 
            unable to do anything to prevent the gulf from widening. The <a href="https://www.bahraingp.com/" target="_blank">Bahrain GP 2024</a>
            started out with the Red Bulls dominating with Max Verstappen clearing pole position, followed by Carlos Sainz from
            Ferrari and at P3 we have Sergio Perez from Red Bull.

       <p class="p2">This year&apos;s team standing introduces Kick Sauber as a new team on track.
        They have been on a recruitment drive, too, with sources saying several senior personnel with recent
        experience working at F1&apos;s biggest teams having already signed on the dotted line and are anticipated to join over the course of the year.
        <br><br>
        The Sauber-run team must do better this year, in part for motivation but importantly to prove to Audi
        that the team can deliver their end of the bargain with the chassis (as the German manufacturer focuses
        on producing their first Formula 1 power unit).
